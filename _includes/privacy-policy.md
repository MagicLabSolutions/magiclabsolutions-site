### Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **Magic Lab Solutions** (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you use our mobile applications and related services, including **MyRenewals: Sub Track & Cancel**.

By using our app, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.  
If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.

### Information We Collect

We collect only the data necessary to provide and improve the app’s functionality.

#### 1. Personal Data
We may collect limited personal information if you choose to contact us for support, such as:
* Your email address  
* Any details you voluntarily include in your support request

#### 2. Usage Data
The app may collect non-identifiable data automatically, including:
* App version and device type  
* Operating system version  
* Anonymous analytics on feature usage (if enabled)  
* Crash reports and performance logs  

We use these insights solely to improve stability and functionality — not for advertising or profiling.

#### 3. Subscription Data
Data you add inside the app (e.g., subscription names, costs, notes, or categories) is stored **locally on your device** and optionally backed up to iCloud if you have iCloud enabled.  
We **do not** have access to your personal subscription data.

### How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
* Provide and maintain the app  
* Send local notifications (reminders) for upcoming renewals  
* Respond to user support requests  
* Improve app reliability and user experience  
* Comply with legal obligations

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

---

### Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely on your device or within Apple’s iCloud infrastructure (if you choose to sync).  
We do not maintain external databases containing user data.  

While we take reasonable precautions to protect information, no system is 100% secure. You use the app at your own risk.

---

### Third-Party Services

Our app may use the following trusted third-party services for functionality and analytics:

* **Apple App Store / Google Play** — handles purchases, billing, and subscription management.  
* **Apple iCloud** (optional) — for secure data backup and sync.  
* **Crash reporting / analytics tools** (e.g., Apple or Firebase Crashlytics) — to help diagnose app issues.  

Each provider follows their own privacy policies and data protection practices.

### Children’s Privacy

Our apps are not intended for children under 13.  
We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.  
If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us to request deletion.

### International Data Transfers

As we use cloud-based tools provided by Apple or Google, your data may be processed in other countries where those providers operate.  
We ensure all data transfers comply with applicable privacy laws, including GDPR standards for EU users.

---

### Your Rights (GDPR / EU Users)

If you reside in the European Union, you have the right to:
* Access, correct, or delete your personal data

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” above and post the new version on this page.  
Continued use of the app after changes take effect means you accept the updated policy.
