### Why MyRenewals?

We all forget about subscriptions — streaming, storage, software — and end up paying for services we no longer use.  
**MyRenewals** keeps you informed with smart notifications, monthly spend summaries, and an easy overview of your upcoming renewals.

### Features

* **Monthly Spend Summary**  
  Instantly see your total subscription cost this month.

* **Pie Chart by Category**  
  Visualize where your money goes — Entertainment, Work, Productivity, and more.

* **Upcoming Renewals**  
  Stay ahead with renewal dates, prices, and status tags (warning when renewal is near).

* **Smart Notifications**  
  Choose to be reminded 3, 7, or 14 days before a charge.

* **iPad-Optimized Layout**  
  See charts, totals, and your subscription list side by side in a beautiful split view.

* **Custom Categories**  
  Tag subscriptions to organize your spending.

### Privacy & Transparency

Your data is yours.  
All subscriptions and notes are stored locally on your device using **Core Data**, and only synced to the cloud if you enable backup.

We never sell or share your information.
