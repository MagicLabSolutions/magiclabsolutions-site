I'm a product-minded mobile developer obsessed with crafting apps that feel intuitive, polished, and fast. I lead projects end to end—ideation, UX, architecture, development, deployment, and iteration—so teams can think bigger while I handle the details that make an app stand out in the App Store or Google Play.

## What I Build

* Native iOS and Android apps with smooth animations and responsive layouts
* Cross-platform experiences with Flutter and React Native for consistent delivery
* Scalable backends and APIs that keep features real-time and reliable
* Data-rich dashboards, offline-first workflows, and secure authentication
* CI/CD pipelines that accelerate releases without sacrificing quality

## How I Deliver

* Discovery workshops to clarify goals, users, and success metrics
* UX prototypes and design systems tailored for mobile-first journeys
* Clean, test-covered codebases that are easy to evolve with your product
* Performance profiling, monitoring, and analytics to grow retention
* App Store and Google Play launch playbooks, maintenance, and updates

Have an idea you'd like to bring to life? Let's build it together.
