At Magic Lab Solutions, we live and breathe Apple's platforms. From the first sketches to the final TestFlight build, we craft Swift-first experiences tailored to iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Every pixel, animation, and haptic gets the attention it needs so your product feels fast, intuitive, and unmistakably native.

## What I Build

* Swift and SwiftUI apps with buttery-smooth navigation and custom transitions
* Universal layouts that adapt beautifully across iPhone, iPad, and the Dynamic Island
* watchOS, widget, and Live Activity extensions that surface the right info at the right time
* App Intents, Siri Shortcuts, and Share Sheet integrations that delight power users
* Privacy-first storage with Core Data, CloudKit sync, and secure Keychain access

## How I Deliver

* Discovery sprints to clarify user needs, product vision, and App Store goals
* Interactive prototypes and design systems aligned with the latest Human Interface Guidelines
* Modular architectures (MVVM, Combine, async/await) and automated testing for confident scaling
* Performance tuning, accessibility audits, and crash monitoring to keep experiences polished
* Launch support, from TestFlight betas to App Store submissions, release notes, and ASO follow-through
